# Hi Folks, I'm Niren Patel 👋🏻 👨‍💻 

I'm an HTML developer. I've started HTML and CSS learning with the help of Youtube & Udemy 💻 in the last 6 months. I have created some HTML pages with CSS. Before 6 Months I did not belong to the IT industry :sweat_smile: but I'm very curious about Learning web development :grimacing:.
When I started at that time :alarm_clock: I thought it's easy for learning :wink: But I got some difficulty with CSS :sweat: because I did learn by myself :sunglasses:.
But now I'm able to create a Web Page using HTML and CSS with attractive UI :bowtie:.

I've good knowledge of the below tech stack and libraries 💻:
- Html5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- Bootstrap

I am always curious :bulb: about things and enjoy learning and I like to solve problems and fix errors 🤖.

In my spare time, I play music 🎧, painting 🎨, reading 📚. I believe that the skills that I have attained from the dynamic environment and life define me and I am looking forward to implementing and polishing them in any opportunities that I receive.
